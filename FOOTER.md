# Get involved

Feel free to add a PR with a new or old article you found on the internet. The structure is simple, just look at existing entries. Run `make` and check in the resulting `README.md` along with your updated `entries.json`.

}
```

## TODO

+ merge complaints with the same ideas under the same names (make the complaints list smaller)
+ sort reverse index by the number of articles which have that complain (popular complains to the top)
